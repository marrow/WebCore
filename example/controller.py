	This is "mounted" to the `Root` class, below, as an attribute named `child`; only the attribute name is
	particularly important as it is used as the matched path element during object dispatch descent.
	
	Controller classes effectively represent a template for a directory in a virtual filesystem. Assigning a class to
	an attribute "creates the folder" in the containing class, where callable attributes like methods are "files".
	Dispatch will take care of instantiating any class children, as requested during descent on each request, however,
	because this child controller is statically mounted, no arguments will be passed to the constructor other than the
	current `RequestContext`.
	
	*Important note:* Class instances are request-local. This might not equate to thread local depending on your host
	environment and WSGI server. Try to only rely on what is given to your controller in the context, either passing
	the context itself down, or by extracting the values from it that your controller would need later. Use of global
	state would prevent co-hosting of multiple WebCore applications in a single process, too.
