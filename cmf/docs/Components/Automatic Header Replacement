Automatic header image replacement, allowing semantic markup with pretty fonts.

For an example of a similar module, see: http://code.google.com/p/django-image-replacement/


Goal:

 * To automatically match H1->H6 tags in output, adding individual CSS necessary to load an image and hide the text.

Methodology:

 * Provide a method of the controller to generate and return the images, or redirect to cached images if enabled.
 * Use a Genshi match template, or series of templates wrapped in conditionals, to add the necessary class="" and style="" properties.

User Customization:

 * Restrict the headers to replace.  (H2 and H3 only?)
 * Enable / disable caching.  (Stored in the data folder, made accessible as TW are.)
 * Specify font metrics for the given header sizes.
 * Define additional classes to style.
 * Upload fonts directly.  (Stored in the data folder.)
