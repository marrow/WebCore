TuneCore is a centralized distribution hub helping both signed and independent artists deliver their music and music videos to the world.

The idea is simple: offer a low-cost, self-managed portal for the upload and purchase of media distribution.  Unfortunately, their website is very 1998.

Using an Adobe Air application or your web browser you can upload single songs or queue up whole albums.  Extensive detail can be entered for delivery to sites which support extended information.  Eventually a desktop (Windows, Mac, Linux; GTK?) application can be made available to rip/preprocess before upload.

(The entire site is powered by TuneCore's extensive open API.  See: http://code.google.com/p/tunecoredirect/)

Many items on the site are automated; yearly payments for media distribution, additional statistical processing, swag... and payments to Paypal or via cheque can also be automated at the user's discretion: monthly, quarterly, etc.

An Album has a number of additional properties over and above a standard asset (see Asset Basic Properties), but uses the publication date already present to identify when to go live:

upc             UPC code.  E.g. 859701269717.  Can be supplied or one automatically generated.


Track is a type of file with additional properties:

isrc            IRSC code.  E.g. USTC70877991.  Can be supplied or one automatically generated.
