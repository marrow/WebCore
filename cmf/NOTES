Random notes and ramblings from the author:

 * Standard notation for Asset properties (and session properties) is:
    * cmf.component:property
    * cmf.package.component:property

 * The following are added to the global template namespace:
    * cmf - A namespace dictionary.
       * root - The controller instance representing the root of the site.

 * Authentication (no matter the provider) stores a reference to an Account sub-class instance in session['cmf.authentication:account']
