Overview
========

The TimeAgo relative time extension is provided as a clear example of a
ToscaWidget-based extension to the TurboCMF framework.  It replaces date
representations site-wide with relative strings, for example:

    January 1, 2000 at 12:00

Becomes:

    about three months ago


Installation
============

Run the following command from your virtual environment, or drop a
pre-compiled EGG file into the appropriate folder:

    easy_install TurboCMF-Xtn-TimeAgo


Usage
=====

After installing the component, navigate to a protected part of your site (we
recommend a folder called ``extensions`` off of the root or the control panel)
and create a new instance of the TimeAgo extension. It has no settings, so you
will be directed back to the instance's container when you are done. Remember
to configure a Publication date, or the extension will not be live!
