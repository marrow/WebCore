Overview
========

Breadcrumb navigation lists assets from the site root to your current location
on the site, allowing users to quickly navigate back up the tree. For example:

    Root > Compnay > About > Staff


Installation
============

Run the following command from your virtual environment, or drop a
pre-compiled EGG file into the appropriate folder:

    easy_install TurboCMF-Xtn-Breadcrumb


Usage
=====

After installing the component, navigate to a protected part of your site (we
recommend a folder called ``extensions`` off of the root or the control panel)
and create a new instance of the Breadcrumb extension. It has no settings, so
you will be directed back to the instance's container when you are done.
Remember to configure a Publication date, or the extension will not be live!
