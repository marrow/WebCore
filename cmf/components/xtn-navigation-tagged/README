Overview
========

Tagged navigation displays a simple navigation list (to be styled in the site
CSS) generated by searching the site for assets tagged with ``navigation`` or
tagged with a tag beginning with ``navigation:``.  The difference will be
explained below.


Installation
============

Run the following command from your virtual environment, or drop a
pre-compiled EGG file into the appropriate folder:

    easy_install TurboCMF-Xtn-Navigation-Tagged


Usage
=====

After installing the component, navigate to a protected part of your site (we
recommend a folder called ``extensions`` off of the root or the control panel)
and create a new instance of the Tagged Navigation extension.  It has no
settings, so you will be directed back to the instance's container when you
are done.  Remember to configure a Publication date, or the extension will not
be live!

To add an asset to the navigation using its current title as the label, tag
the asset with ``navigation``.  If you wish to override the title to appear in
the menu, tag the asset with the label you wish to use prefixed by
``navigation:``.  For example, tagging a Blog asset titled "My Awesome Blog"
to show up in navigation as just "Blog":

    ``"navigation:Blog"``
