Overview
========

Google Analytics is one of the most popular website visitor statistics
gathering tools available on the internet today. This extension will add
automatic Google Analytics integration to your TurboCMF site.


Installation
============

Run the following command from your virtual environment, or drop a
pre-compiled EGG file into the appropriate folder:

    easy_install TurboCMF-Xtn-Analytics-Google


Usage
=====

After installing the component, navigate to a protected part of your site (we
recommend a folder called ``extensions`` off of the root or the control panel)
and create a new instance of the Google Analytics extension. You will be
brought to the configuration page where you must enter your analytics token.
Remember to configure a Publication date, or the extension will not be live!

Tokens look like:

    ``UA-1234567-1``

You can use the interface to override the token for individual sections of the
site.
