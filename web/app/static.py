	"""Serve files from disk.
	
	This utility endpoint factory is meant primarily for use in development environments; in production environments
	it is better (more efficient, secure, etc.) to serve your static content using a front end load balancer such as
	Nginx.
	
	The first argument, `base`, represents the base path to serve files from. Paths below the attachment point for
	the generated endpoint will combine this base path with the remaining path elements to determine the file to
	serve.
	
	The second argument is an optional dictionary mapping filename extensions to template engines, for cooperation
	with the TemplateExtension.  (See: https://github.com/marrow/template)  The result of attempting to serve a
	mapped path is a 2-tuple of `("{mapping}:{path}", dict())`. For example, to render all `.html` files as Mako
	templates, you would attach something like the following:
	
		class Root:
			page = static('/path/to/static/pages', dict(html='mako'))
	
	By default the "usual culprits" are served with far-futures cache expiry headers. If you wish to change the
	extensions searched just assign a new `far` iterable.  To disable, assign any falsy value.
