	The allowable controller structures offered by individual methods of dispatch is documented in the relevant

	* Object Dispatch: https://github.com/marrow/web.dispatch.object
	* Registered Routes: https://github.com/marrow/web.dispatch.route
	* Traversal: https://github.com/marrow/web.dispatch.traversal
