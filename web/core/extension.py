"""WebCore extension management.

This extension registry handles loading and access to extensions as well as the collection of standard WebCore
Extension API callbacks. Reference the `SIGNALS` constant for a list of the individual callbacks that can be
utilized and their meanings, and the `extension.py` example for more detailed descriptions.

At a basic level an extension is a class. That's it; attributes and methods are used to inform the manager
of extension metadata and register callbacks for certain events. The most basic extension is one that does
nothing:

	class Extension: pass

To register your extension, add a reference to it to your project's `entry_points` in your project's `setup.py`
under the `web.extension` namespace:

	setup(
		...,
		entry_points = {'web.extension': [
				'example = myapp:Extension',
			]},
	)

Your extension may define several additional properties:

* `provides` -- declare a set of tags describing the features offered by the plugin
* `needs` -- delcare a set of tags that must be present for this extension to function
* `uses` -- declare a set of tags that must be evaluated prior to this extension, but aren't hard requirements
* `first` -- declare that this extension is a dependency of all other non-first extensions if truthy
* `last` -- declare that this extension depends on all other non-last extensions if truthy
* `signals` -- a set of additional signal names declared used (thus cacheable) by the extension manager

Tags used as `provides` values should also be registered as `web.extension` entry points. Additional `signals` may be
prefixed with a minus symbol (-) to request reverse ordering, simulating the exit path of WSGI middleware.
