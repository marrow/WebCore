"""The WebCore view registry.

WebCore uses a registry of callables to transform values returned by controllers for use as a response. This
translation process is used to support the built-in types (see the `base` extension) and can be extended by your
own application to support additional types.  This is effectively the "view" component of Model-View-Controller.

A view handler takes the result of calling a controller endpoint and applies the result to the response. It can be
as simple as a bare function that accepts the current `RequestContext` instance plus the value returned by the
endpoint, and either returns a truthy value to indicate successful handling, or a falsy value to indicate that this
view handler could not handle the result. The simplest case is a handler that always "passes the buck" and handles
nothing:

	def ignore(context, result):
		pass

Slightly more useful would be to assign the result directly to the response:

	def stringy(context, result):
		context.response.text = result
		return True

As an example pulled from the "template" extension, you can use an "exit early" strategy to selectively handle
subsets of the type your view is registered against, such as only handling 2-tuples with a specific first value:

	def json(context, result):
		from json import dumps
		if len(result) != 2 or result[0] != 'json':
			return
		context.response.text = dumps(result)
		return True

A view may go so far as to wholly replace the `context.response` object; any callable WSGI application can be
utilized as such. Cooperative response construction is _strongly_ preferred, however.

If you frequently hand back serialized data, you may be able to simplify your controller code and reduce
boilerplate by simply returning your model instances.  By registering a view handler for your model class you can
implement the serialization in a single, centralized location, making security and testing much easier.

When a controller raises an `HTTPError` subclass it is treated as the return value.  As such you can take specific
action on any given error by registering a view handler for the specific exception subclass (i.e. `HTTPNotFound`),
such as rendering a pretty error page.  By default these exceptions are treated as a WSGI application and are
directly used as the response, but only if no more specific handlers are registered.
